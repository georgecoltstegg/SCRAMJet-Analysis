# SCRAMJet Engine Analysis
## Texas A&M University 
### AERO 351 Project #2

Attached inside this github repository is the [Python Code](/Scripts/351_SCRAMjet_Project2.py) and plots produced by this code for the analysis of a SCRAMJet Engine. These plots compare Specific Thrust, Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC), Various Efficiencies, and the Fuel to Air Ration versus Mach Number for a Mach range of 2-5. These values can be seen below:
